        <p>The project aims to provide a facile courier management system, built with PHP and MySQL. The system helps manage and keep track of consignment data and their delivery status. The users can view and track details regarding their shipment such as order date, package dimensions, estimated delivery date, source and destination address etc. The admin users(employees) can create, update and delete shipments listed on the system. Employees with manager privileges can also register new employee users on the system.The system can be used to better monitor the progress of shipments from pickup to delivery.</p>
